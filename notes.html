    <h1>How to Make a Web Page</h1>
    
    <h2>Tools to Write Your Page</h2>
    <p>
        You downloaded Sublime Text and installed Sublime Text's package manager. 

        Install <a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmet</a>. They have a pretty helpful video.
    </p>
    <p>You're set!</p>
    

    <h2>Tools to Look at Your Page (or Anyone's)</h2>
    <p>
       Open the <em>Developer Tools</em>.


       Hey is there a line break in the HTML document above this sentence? What about below?<br>Look at the source.
       It should look like your HTML document.
    </p>

    <p>Reload the webpage with <span class="keypress">command shift r</span> to see changes</p>

    <h2>On the Page</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>What's a tag?</li>
        <li>What's a closing tag?</li>
        <li>What's an element?</li>
        <li>Are list items (li) inline or block elements?</li>
        <li>Are some elements self closing?
        <li>What happens if you for get a closing tag?</li>

    </ul>

    Can I write stuff in my html document that doesn't show up on the web page?

    <!-- Yes, it's called a "comment" and you have to put it between these weird symbols. 

    In Sublime, "Command + /" is the keyboard shortcut to comment something out.  -->

    <h3>Making things Stylish</h3>
    <p>
        You're going to need CSS aka Cascading Style Sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sheet will have to be linked to this one in the "head" section.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's a <span class="selectory" id="unique1">selector</span>?
        What's a <span class="selectory" id="unique2">property</span>?
        What's a <span class="selectory" id="unique3">value</span>?
    </p>

    <h3>Color</h3>
    <p>Colors are pretty fun.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/">You can use color by names the internet agreed on without you.
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool">You can use color by number too.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Document Tree</h2>

    <p>Can you find parents, children, siblings for different elements?</p>

    <p>Did I type parents/children in any ordered way in the html document? Did it matter in the browser?</p>

    <p>
        Try out some <b>emmet</b> tricks. 
        Type <span  class="keypress">h1+p*3</span> then <span  class="keypress">tab</span>  and see what happens. Make sure your cursor is just after "3" when you push tab.
        Are h1 and p siblings or parent/child?
    </p>
    <p>
        Type <span class="keypress">ol#list>li*10</span> then <span  class="keypress">tab</span> and see what happens. 
        Are ol and li siblings or parent/child?
    </p>

    <img src="cat.jpg" alt="Is this inline or block?">

Now can I write stuff in my html document that doesn't show up on the web page?

What happens if you loose a closing tag?
